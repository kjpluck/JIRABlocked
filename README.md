Highlights any JIRA tasks with 'BLOCKED' in the title

A useful technique for project management is to mark tickets as blocked. In our projects we do this by editing the task title and adding BLOCKED.

This extension for both Firefox and Chrome simply highlights these tasks with a red dotted border.
